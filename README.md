# StackOverflow Tag Prediction - Natural Language Processing

Here our objective is to predict tags for posts from StackOverflow using Linear Model after carefully preprocessing our text features.

# Note : This project is in process. Although Part 1 is complete and working, its readme and some additional functions will be added to it like analyzing coefficients and also some comparision with other models . Also an alternative method for preprocessing the data will be added as a separate file. 
# Second part will demonstrate using CNN-1D for tag prediction
